Paging is supported(the Github search API only supports paging up to 1000 pages)

You can refine your search by selecting either "Best Match" or "Star Rating". You can also filter by the languages you are interested in.

## Running the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `nmp build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Room for improvement

* Bullet list
Split state into more manageable chunks to reduce re-renders(combineReducers)
* Bullet list
Allow user to choose a theme which is not my current "loud and proud" theme.
Allow user to add multiple topics to refine search
Allow user to control page size
